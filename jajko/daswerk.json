Ihr positiver Vibe ist unverkennbar. Albert und Pablo kommen aus einer Gegend, die sonst eher mit großen Problemen, als mit schönen Momenten assoziiert wird. Von ihrem Leben dort handeln ihre Texte. Albert und Pablo reflektieren ihren Alltag, formulieren Hoffnungen und Sorgen und schaffen es Probleme sehr klar zu benennen, ohne in klischeehafte Parolen oder politische Phrasen zu verfallen. Sie erzählen Geschichten, von Freundschaft und Euphorie, aber auch von großer Traurigkeit und bitterer Realität. Die Kraft, trotz aller schwierigen Momente, trotzdem ein positives, aufgeschlossenes und sensibles Gefühl zur Welt und zu den Mitmenschen zu behalten, verkörpern wenige so glaubwürdig wie sie. Das liegt nicht zuletzt an ihren Aktivitäten wie dem “100 Tage Sommer“, der “Tour de Ost” oder ihrem Engagement für Menschen am Rand der Gesellschaft.

März", "19:30 Uhr", "Konzert", "TICKET LINK", "BIO: DREAM NAILS – YOU WISH Written by Emma Wilkes Dream Nails [Mimi Jasson, Lucy Katz, Anya Pearson] are asking different questions nowadays. They made their name with energised, empathetic, yet politically conscious punk, bursting onto the scene with their 2020 self-titled debut before signing to Marshall Records for their 2023 follow-up, Doom Loop. Those qualities are still intact, but now their lens has taken on a softer, yet no less astute, focus. They’re becoming inquisitive, they’re searching for optimism, and crucially, they’re recalibrating. Along with this, Dream Nails are operating as a trio for the first time, with bassist Mimi Jasson stepping up to take on lead vocals. Becoming a tighter-knit unit has galvanised them all over again as they searched for new avenues for their creativity. “The world that we live in is so complicated, and the old ways of trying to challenge it or make art about it aren’t working for us anymore,” says drummer Lucy Katz. “We wanted to regroup and f ind a new kind of creative and spiritual response to our times.” Nonetheless, they’re not ignoring the world outside their windows. Instead, they’re searching for and connecting with a sense of inclusive humanity. Their interest in stories of strength and resilience speaks to this, as pertinent to one’s personal life as to activism. After all, you can’t change the world by pouring from an empty cup. “We are still relating to the world in an innately political way,” explains guitarist Anya Pearson. “But we started asking more universal questions – what it would be like to speak to animals, what is our relationship with the elements of fire and water, how do we stay human in the age of technology? We’re more interested in asking the questions than providing the answers.” Amid a busy 2024 in which they headlined The Grace in their hometown, toured the UK and Europe opening for Thus Love and headed for the US to play SXSW, they planted the seeds for their new era. Convening in Lucy’s living room, they poured all their inspiration onto paper – what they wanted to do, who they wanted to be, the sounds they wanted to channel – and began free writing. This time around, their respective roles were more f luid – instead of remaining in their designated lanes, everyone worked on every aspect of the record from melodies to lyrics. “The fact that we’re working now as a trio has made our creative relationship much tighter,” notes Lucy. “The thing that’s special about this album is that it really feels like all of ours equally. It feels much more cohesive between the three of us, too.” Meanwhile, the task of stepping up from being a backing vocalist to a lead vocalist for the first time required Mimi, a classical and contemporary trained pianist, to build on her craft, undergoing vocal coaching to help. “The dynamics of your voice become so much more intimate and important,” she explains. “You can’t see your instrument; it has to come through feeling. There are parts of your body you wouldn’t normally focus on; I’m figuring out different resonances in my body and finding the muscles to use when I want to scream without hurting my voice. It’s been such a learning experience.” Elsewhere, the music was shifting and morphing around her. Their punk spirit remains preserved in amber, but nowadays, Dream Nails are more eclectic than they’ve ever been. They have no reservations about getting weird and surreal, especially as a means of talking back to a progressively darkening world. Adding to the album’s mystical, otherworldly tone, intertwined with its ideas about connecting with the universe and requesting its guidance, there seemed to be a spiritual way in which their initial ideas revealed themselves. “The parts of the songs I wrote came from a culmination of years of listening, learning and playing. When you are free writing or jamming it comes out as something that’s uniquely yours. And it’s cool to share that with other people you’re writing with and have everyone’s experiences come together,” notes Mimi. Nonetheless, there was still some sculpting involved. “You’ve got to strike the balance between what’s instinctively good and what you know could be better,” adds Anya. “It’s about trusting the energy you’re receiving but also guiding it.” The word Dream Nails lands on to underpin the feeling of their music this time around is primal. They became more tactile, with Lucy sometimes playing the drums barefoot and using hand percussion for a more textured sound. Perhaps there had always been a primitiveness inherent in their music, but they’ve learned to push that feeling into the foreground. “Our main live set-up is literally just a bass, one guitar and drums, so it can sound really elemental,” says Anya. „At the end of the day, we’re just three people with three acoustic instruments doing everything we can to make a massive sound, connecting to the primal forces we all have within ourselves. That’s what we tried to embrace on this record.”"], "location": "Das Werk", "lineup": "-"},

Nach ihrem gefeierten Debüt „Aurora“ (2018) – das von Stereogum als „phenomenal“ und „one of the best shoegaze albums of all time“ bezeichnet wurde – tourten die Belgier:innen unermüdlich und bauten sich eine weltweite Fangemeinde auf, die von ihren eindringlichen Klangwelten in ihren Bann gezogen wurde.", "Mit ihrem zweiten Album „Hush“ (2021) setzten sie ihren Aufstieg und Höhenflug fort, spielten ausverkaufte Shows rund um den Globus und ernteten internationalen Beifall – von Fans und Kritiker:innen gleichermaßen. Danach trat neue Musik bei Slow Crush für eine Weile in den Hintergrund, da sich die Band auf das Touring konzentrierte – was neue Perspektiven und kreative Ansätze mit sich brachte.", "Als die Zeit für neue Aufnahmen gekommen war, machten sich Sängerin/Bassistin Isa Holliday, Gitarrist Jelle Ronsmans und Schlagzeuger Frederik Meeuwis auf den Weg nach Großbritannien, um dort mit Produzent Lewis Johns an neuem Material zu arbeiten. Johns ermutigte die Band zu musikalischen Experimenten und mehr Spontaneität. Und dieser Geist der Transformation zieht sich nun auch durch das gesamte neue Album. Klanglich ist „Thirst“ – wie der im August 2025 erscheinende, dritte Longplayer heißen wird – härter und vielschichtiger als seine Vorgänger. Es kontrastiert verträumten Gesang mit düsteren Gitarren und fängt eine neue emotionale Intensität ein. Isa hat sich in ihren Lyrics und ihrer stimmlichen Performance tiefer als je zuvor in die Materie eingegraben, um Themen wie emotionales Burnout oder das Auf und Ab des Lebens zu erforschen.", "In seinem Kern spiegelt „Thirst“ den Wunsch nach Klarheit und emotionaler Aufrichtigkeit wider – ein Gleichgewicht zwischen Schwere und Intimität. Es ist eine Platte, die davon handelt, gefesselt und doch schwerelos zu sein, verloren und doch auf der Suche. Und es animiert seine Hörenden dazu, Musik auch als Raum für Stille, Reflexion und Transzendenz zu begreifen.", "„We want people to feel embraced by the music,” sagt Isa. „To let go and be taken somewhere else – into another dimension, even. A place where they can just be present.” Die „Pforte“ zu dieser anderen Dimension findet sich Anfang November im Das Werk Wien – und wir sind „thirsty“ nach dem neue Slow-Crush-Material!"], "location": "Das Werk", "lineup": "-"},

The K’s, Merseyside’s four-strong, rousing, real-world-documenting indie phenomenon, brought up in a town caught between other places, used every benefit and drawback of out-of-the-way youth to create their adored, masterpiece debut album, I Wonder If The World Knows? and watch as it reached the Top 3 of the UK Official Album Chart at the first time of asking.", "It’s a success made of belief. A success catalysed by the achievements of sell-out UK-wide tours, cresting with a 3,700-capacity ‘homecoming’ at Manchester’s O2 Victoria Warehouse, being handed the Best Breakthrough Act award at the 2024 Nordoff Robbins Northern Music Awards (aka The Northern Brits) and reaching major festival stages, including their Glastonbury debut in 2024, in addition to main stage appearances at Leeds, Reading and Isle of Wight Festivals, Camp Bestival, Kendal Calling and more. Knowing just those small parts of their story, who would have bet against The K’s turning out to be the band so many lost music lovers, young or old, cut adrift on seas of similarly staid suburban life, have been anxiously waiting for?", "Beyond the plaudits and awards, beyond the radio play across BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music, Radio X and Absolute Radio and beyond the more than 2 million streams per month is the connection to a battalion of fans, many who have been there since their emergence in 2017. Circling a band that’s endlessly grateful for their support, so many more have caught the bug since. Speaking to NME in April 2024, front man and songwriter, Jamie Boyle, revealed that the band sees, in numerous exchanges between fans and kind words they receive directly, repeated confirmations that The K’s music has provided salvation in times of trouble. “That is worth more than any Number One ever could be,” he said. “We’re literally having a massive effect on people’s lives.”", "Bands can do that. The K’s, made up of Boyle (vocals/guitar) Ryan Breslin (guitar/keyboards), Dexter Baker (bass) and Nathan Peers (drums), forming in Earlestown in 2017, have become one of those bands, yet the romance in their story doesn’t include any lines dedicated to overnight success. Quite the opposite. Giving a black eye to any critics of guitar-based indie as unintelligent or unambitious, The K’s debut single in 2017, Sarajevo, delved into the history books to find an unlikely formula of upfront, festival-ready songwriting and 20th Century European political upheaval. From the start, The K’s had gone beyond the ordinary.", "Despite growing rapidly through regional venues (hitting the 1,000-capacity Manchester Academy 2 in 2019 after a handful of indie releases, including with Alan McGee’s Creation23 label), the band has released just their one, first and only album. What happened in the seven years from Sarajevo to I Wonder If The World Knows? Patience is what happened. “I’m really glad we’ve taken our time, and not rushed into anything,” said Breslin when questioned by Celeb Mix on the album campaign trail earlier this year. “I remember back in", "2020 we were all feeling a bit frustrated because we felt like COVID had really set us back, but in hindsight, I think taking that little bit of a step back from everything was a smart move.”", "In a world that’s always thinking one step beyond today, The K’s have taken care to live in the moment and craft songs that mean something to them and so much other people. Marquee singles from their album, No Place Like Home (600,000 Spotify streams) and Heart On My Sleeve (800,000 Spotify streams) rush with ambition yet are grounded in lyrical realism, offering as much open-hearted vulnerability and honesty as cranked-up, celebratory expressions of optimism. Giving it away line by line, such as on No Place Like Home – “Oh, but when it rains, then it pours / and I’m not moaning / I just want my serotonin levels / back to what they were before” – Boyle and the band have gained their listeners’ admiration, trust and loyalty by virtue of them holding up a mirror to the realities of their shared lives. It’s their authenticity that has counted the most.", "In the same conversation with NME, Boyle opened up on the personal nature of the songs on I Wonder If The World Knows? confiding in the journalist, saying: “I feel like people can tell when someone isn’t being authentic. I want those songs to give people hope as well. It’s still a sensitive thing to talk about but a lot of the songs are about my battles with mental health. I’m living my dream every single day but there are plenty of times where I’ll feel like absolute shit. Maybe if people see that, it’ll make whatever they’re going through seem less scary.”", "Disparate influences make up The K’s sound, having quoted Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, The Clash and The Jam most regularly as legends they admire and have, at one time or another, given them the motivation to pick up their instruments and create something new. In supporting Blossoms at their biggest ever outdoor show in summer 2024, stepping onto a stage before a potential 30,000 people, or accompanying Liam Gallagher as his Malta Weekender, The K’s will take up any opportunity undaunted. Knowing they have earned the right to be there, while honoured to be recognised by their peers, their destiny was mapped out by determination, faith and carrying each other over the line when it looked like the end of the road when, in fact, they were looking towards the horizon.", "“I remember playing to my dad and two of his mates who weren’t even watching us,” said Breslin, in an interview with the Official Charts website. “Thank God we stuck at it through those times. If you believe in what you’re doing and love it, f**king stick at it!”", "8 months down the line and The K’s are breaking all previous personal records with the presale numbers on their follow up album ‘Pretty On The Internet’ which if released even today (which is months ahead of its 2025 release date) would already sit comfortably in the UK top 10 already on presale figures alone. The K’s are about to announce their biggest ever UK tour, the ‘Pretty On The Internet’ tour, taking in venues like London’s 3000 capacity Roundhouse and even double that in Manchester, along with 2000+ cap venues across the board in between. The band are also already announcing runs of UK and International Festivals to follow on from 2024’s hugely expansive and successful summer season, including mainstage appearances at the likes of Reading & Leeds and The Isle of Wight as well as packing out the 12000 Woodsies stage at Glastonbury."], "location": "Das Werk", "lineup": "-"},
